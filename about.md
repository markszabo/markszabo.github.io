I'm Mark, a Hungarian engineer living in Japan. I moved here in the summer of 2019, and I quickly fall in love with the cuntry, so I plan on staying here for a while. I enjoy discovering the similarities and differences between everyday life in Japan and Europe (mostly Hungary, but I also spent a semester in Germany and 2 semesters in Italy during my university studies), should it be about transportation, food, shopping or religion. Thus I try to stay away of the foreigner bubble and discover the less touristic Japan.

I work as an application security engineer, which I like to define as I help engineers build secure systems. When I wanted to move to Japan, I applied for 24 various engineer positions, that didn't require any Japanese knowledge. I had interviews with 3 companies, got an offer from [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/). They handled the entire Visa process, and got me a [Highly Skilled Professional](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/long/visa16.html) visa for 5 years. The offer included a very generous relocation package that included the flight tickets, private Japanese lessons for a year, accomodation for the first 45 days, help with opening a bank account, getting a SIM card and going to the city hall for registering my address, and an additional budget to offset part of the initial costs of renting a house (e.g. deposit). This help made the whole relocation as seemless and easy as possible. After almost 2 years I decided to change companies and joining [Woven Planet](https://www.woven-planet.global/) in June 2021.

In my free time I like to explore and learn about Japan. I've been commuting to work by bike for a few years now, and last year due to COVID I got more serious about cycling: got myself a roadbike and rode it to Chiba, Nikko, Izu, ÅŒyama, and most recently to Kyoto.
