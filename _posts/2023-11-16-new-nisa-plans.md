title: Investing plans with the upcoming new NISA
tags: japan money
---

From 2024 Japan's tax-free investment system, NISA, is getting [a major overhaul](https://www.retirejapan.com/nisa/#2024-nisa). Investments made within the system are tax-free, with the only major limitation on yearly and lifetime contribution limits, and that a third of the limits can only be used for mutual funds. This is not a retirement scheme, and there is no penalty for selling early. With this in mind, in this post I will review how I plan to invest from 2024.

## What to invest in

Going with the general advice and ["Diversification is the only free lunch"](https://www.netwealth.com/ourviews/diversification-is-the-only-free-lunch-in-investing/), I'll continue to invest in low-cost diversified index funds or ETFs.

### Which index?

Many people invest in S&P500 (the 500 largest companies of the US), which had exceptional returns in the last decades as America became the leading economic power in the world. There are similar indexes in other countries (e.g. [Nikkei 225](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225) for Japan, or [DAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAX) for Germany), and [some people prefer to invest in companies of their own country](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/home-country-bias.asp).

Picking a country and hoping that it continues to do well seems to me like only doing half of the diversification. Will China overtake the US, or will China become the next Japan? Will India or Indonesia be the next China? Will the EU's or Japan's economy wake up? I don't think anybody knows the answer to these questions, especially not at the timeframe I'm investing (majority of it is for retirement 30-40 years from now).

Thus I invest in index funds or ETFs that track the entire world economy. This way as long as the world economy continues to grow, I will make money. 

Is it possible that this assumption is incorrect? Of course. Population is declining in most advanced economies, and population growth globally is also slowing. The UN [expects population to peak around 2080](https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/population#:~:text=Our%20growing%20population&text=The%20world's%20population%20is%20expected,billion%20in%20the%20mid%2D2080s.) with most of the growth coming from the period until 2050. The world has not seen widespread population decline, so we don't know how this will affect the economy. However with declining population other investments are also risky: the price of real estate, and precious metals are both driven by demand, which might decline with less people, and with the huge amount of government debt money printing leading to inflation seems also a likely possible future. So I think that overall investing in the entire global economy is still the best course of action.

## Which fund/ETF?

I already looked at the [existing all-world ETFs in my earlier post](./2022-12-27-all-world-etfs-for-nisa.md). A few learnings I took since then:

1. Always invest in yen denominated securities. This is mostly due to how Japanese taxes work: capital gains are taxed at a fix 20%, but forex gains are considered miscellaneous and taxed at the marginal tax rate (30-40%). Moreover these two being a different tax category, I believe they can't be used to offset each other.
2. If possible find a fund that reinvests dividents. The new NISA has contributions limits only, but the amount in it can grow indefinitely. Automatically reinvesting dividents thus essentially increases the tax-free investment amount.
3. Stay away from currency-hedged investments. Recently the yen dropped to historical lows against the dollar, so some people are looking at funds that provide currency hedge (e.g. if the S&P500 goes from $4500 to $4950, then the fund's value in yen will also increase 10% regardless of the exchange rate change). This sounds good, however it comes at a huge cost that's often hidden in the descriptions. This cost eats into the profit on long time horizonts, while currency fluctuation tends to even out in decades.
4. Avoid funds that wrap other funds to limit [double/triple taxation](https://retirewiki.jp/wiki/Japanese_global_index_funds#The_triple_taxation_problem)

I found that [eMaxis Slim All Country (ｅＭＡＸＩＳ Ｓｌｉｍ 全世界株式（オール・カントリー）)](https://emaxis.jp/fund/253425.html) fits all of these with a low, 0.1144％ yearly fee (this is not too bad even compared to Vanguard's VT's 0.07% fee).

## When to invest?

The new NISA has a yearly limit of 3.6 million yen. Assuming the entire amount is available in January, is it better to invest it immediately or to split it into 12 parts and invest each month?
