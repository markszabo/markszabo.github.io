I'm still pretty far from retirement, but recently I've been looking into how the pension works in Japan, so I'll share my learnings in this post.

<!--break-->

There are multiple sources of pension payments one can receive in Japan, I'll cover the ones that I found relevant for my situation as a full time company employee.

## National Pension, 国民年金

This is mandatory for everybody between the age of 20 and 59 living in Japan. For people who need to pay this for themselves, it costs 16,980 yen/month (regardless of the income), but for full time employees this is included in the Employee's Pension (see below). ([source](https://www.nenkin.go.jp/international/japanese-system/nationalpension/nationalpension.html))

Since everyone pays the same amount, everyone will get the same amount. In 2024 this was ￥816,000 per year, assuming you paid for the full 40 years (20-59 years of age). I moved to Japan when I was 26, so for me this gets prorated and I expected to receive around `34/40*816,000=693,600 yen` (simplified calculation, the real number depends on the actual months I paid into the system so it will be 685,100 yen as I moved to Japan 5 months after my 26th birthday). ([source](<https://www.nenkin.go.jp/international/japanese-system/nationalpension/nationalpension.html#:~:text=Category%20%E2%85%A2%20insured%20person.-,Benefit%20Amount%20(Fiscal%20year%202024),-%EF%BF%A5816%2C000*%20(annual%20benefit>) and my NenkinNet estimate)

While these numbers are pretty low, at least they get adjusted by inflation (sort of), so we can treat them as real numbers (I won't actually get 685,100 yen per year, I will get a higher number, but I will be able to buy the same amount of stuff as 685,100 yen would get me today).

[This reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/comments/1i8q39k/pension_benefits_amount_for_2025/) nicely summarizes the yearly adjustment for 2024:

> As always, and as mandated by law, pension benefits for people under age 68 move in line with average wages (minus the macroeconomic slide), whereas pension benefits for people over age 68 move in line with inflation (minus the macroeconomic slide). This year, average wages were up 2.3% and inflation was 2.7%. The macroeconomic slide was calculated as -0.4%. The same as last year, the macroeconomic slide includes a -0.1% adjustment for the change in the number of pension benefit recipients, and a -0.3% adjustment for the increase in the average life expectancy.
> For example, national pension benefits (Kokumin Nenkin) will increase from ¥68,000 to ¥69,308.

Though that -0.4% is sad: it should have gone up by 2.3% but instead it only went up by 1.9%. If this would stay the same for the next 28 years (until I hit 60), then that will reduce the purchasing power of the pension to (1-0.004)^28=89%. So instead of today's  685,100 yen worth of stuff, I will only be able to get 612,372 yen of stuff. Actually not that bad, if it means that the system stays functional.

**Funding** - So where is the money coming from that is paying for this pension? The basis of it is the classic [pyramid scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_scheme)-style system where current young people are directly funding the current payouts. The aging population threatens the sustainability of this system, which they are trying to address in two ways:

* the macroeconomic slide shown above that slightly reduces the value of the payouts year-over-year to avoid a drastic drop
* the [Government Pension Investment Fund](https://www.gpif.go.jp/en/) (GPIF), which is the largest pool of retirement savings in the world ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Pension_Investment_Fund)) with a whopping 258.7 trillion yen (258.7兆円) under management, which is about 2 million yen per every person in Japan. And this is currently not being used for pension payments yet, and with a rate of return of 4.4%/year (FY2001-FY2024Q3) it will just continue to grow

But this is only 68,000 yen per month for the average person (and only 57,092 yen for me), which is not that much.

## Employees' Pension Insurance, 厚生年金

As a company employee I'm also paying into this second pension, and expect to receive pension from it. Here the contributions are proportional to my salary, and the payout will also depend on the amount contributed.

The contribution is calculated 18.3% of one's base salary + fixed allowances (but not bonuses), and the company pays half of it, while the other half gets deducted from one's salary. So effectively 9.15% gets deducted from each paycheck.

The payout can be calculated with this formula: `5.481*(yearly incomes in all years while contributing)/1000`. So e.g. someone with an average yearly income of 15 million yen and 34 years of contributions this would be 2,795,310 yen per year.

The benefits here also get adjusted by the same method as the national pension, though I'm not sure if that takes into account the contributions (e.g. if I contribute 100,000 yen now or 10 years later, will the former increase my eventual payouts more, since it is worth more now than later).
