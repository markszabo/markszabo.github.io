We just built our house in Tokyo. In this post I will cover how we got internet.

## Choosing the company

I usually do a proper comparison, but for internet we had good experience with [Sony Nuro](https://www.nuro.jp/) in the past, so decided to go with them. Most internet providers use the infrastructure of Docomo, but Nuro brings their own fiber optics to the homes, so it is usually faster and cheaper.

## Timeline

Nuro told us that for detached houses you can apply from 2 months before the desired construction date. The construction can only happen after the house is completed and the handover is done, so we had to wait for that to be decided.

* September 26: Ichijo finalized the date of the handover (about a month before the handover)
* October 9: we signed up for Nuro online
* October 11: Nuro confirmed our application, and asked us to reserve the date of the construction. The earliest date was one months from then (November 10). We chose November 10 afternoon.
* November 10:
