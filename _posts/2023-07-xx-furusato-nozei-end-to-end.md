What is furusato nozei, a bit of history, and how you can do it end to end. *While I do my best to keep this information accurate at the time of publishing, if you find any inaccuracies, please [let me know](https://github.com/markszabo/markszabo.github.io/issues)*.

# 1. What is furusato nozei?

Furusato nozei (ふるさと納税), or home-town tax payment is a scheme by Japan that allows Japanese tax payers to redirect part of their income tax to a city other than where they currently live.
The receiving cities often send some thank you gift in exchange for this, and there are websites set up like webshops where one can choose the city based on the desired gift.

Although [the original intention](#TODO-history) was to let people who moved from the countryside to the city support their old hometown, there is no requirement on which city one can send their tax to, and the program is open for foreigners too (as long as the person pays income tax in Japan).

While in the end furusato nozei is about redirecting part of your income tax, in practice one needs to make an out of pocket donation to the desired city in a given calendar year, and then receive tax refund and/or tax break in the next calendar year equivalent to the donated amount minus 2,000 yen (this is a fixed fee of using the system).

# 2. Income tax

Furusato nozei allows one to redirect part of their income tax, so we need to understand income tax first to fully understand furusato nozei.

The [income tax](https://www.jetro.go.jp/en/invest/setting_up/section3/page7.html) consist of two main parts: 

- the national income tax: a progressive tax rate of 5% to 45%
- residence tax (officially: individual inhabitant tax) a flat 10% split into two parts:
   - Prefectural tax of 4%
   - Municipal tax of 6%

Payment timelines are different for these too:

- national income tax is generally paid in the year when the income is received. For salaried employees by their company withholding it, and then doing a final adjustment in December (YETA, Year-End Tax Adjustment, 年末調整). If one files tax return in February-March next year, it is possible to pay more tax then or receive a tax refund.
- residence tax is based on the prior calendar year's income and calculated in June each year. So the residence tax of May 2023 is based on the income in 2021. Then from June 2023 until May 2024 the residence tax is based on the income of 2022 and so on.

# 2. Paperwork

To receive the tax refund/break, there is some necessary paperwork with two main options:

* [one-stop exception](https://www.town.niseko.lg.jp/chosei/furusato_tax/one_step/?wovn=en): this is a simplified process for people fitting the following criteria:
   - they don't need to file tax return (確定申告, kakutei shinkoku). This is usually company employees where the company takes care of this, and they don't have any other deduction (e.g. medical expenses) or other income (e.g. capital gain/divident where the brokerage doesn't withhold taxes).
   - they only donated to 5 municipalities or less in the calendar year. The limit is on the number of donation destinations, and making multiple donations to the same city still only count as one.
   
   If one  is eligible, they should indicate this when making the donation (there is usually a checkbox), and then the receiving city will send a form to fill out and return. **Important:** these forms [need to arrive to the cities by January 10 the next year](https://mailmate.jp/blog/furusato-nozei#:~:text=Applications%20for%20the%20One%2DStop,10th%20of%20the%20following%20year.), which can be a problem if you donate late December, as many city halls might close early for the year-end holidays.

   Once the forms are returned, there is no other paperwork to do.

* the normal process: if one is not eligible for the one-stop exception (you need to file tax return yourself, or donated to more than 5 places), they need to file tax return and include furusato nozei there. 
   - If filing on paper: after donation the receiving city sends a certificate of donation, which one needs to include with the tax return (*though I have never done this, so correct me if I'm wrong*)
   - If filing online: most furusato websites provide a digitally signed xml file (寄附金控除に関する証明書, Certificate of Donation Deduction) that one can simply upload to the e-Tax website.

# 3. Timeline in practice

* One goes to a [furusato nozei website](#TODO-add-section), selects the desired goods and makes a donation (the flow is very similar to shopping on a webshop, including the payment being done via credit/debit card)
* One receives the donation certificate in the mail with the one-stop exception form (if requested)
* One receives the selected "thank you" goods
* One completes the necessary paperwork:
   - [One-stop exception](#TODO-add-link): simply fill out and return the form sent by the receiving municipality
   - Filing income tax return in February-March next year
* One gets the money back next year:
   - If one-stop exception was used: the national income tax, and the residence tax will be decreased by the amount donated the previous year (national income tax for the calendar year, the residence tax from June to May the next year since that's when they calculate and update it)
   - If tax return was filed: for the national income tax portion
