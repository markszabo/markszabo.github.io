title: Medical tax deduction in Japan
tags: money japan
---

In Japan if one pays more than 100,000 yen of medical expenses in a calendar year, they can deduct it from their pre-tax income (usually leading to an income tax return).
In this post I'll attempt to summarize the rules of this.
As with all my posts, this is not tax advice and do your own research before making any decision.
Also if you find any inaccuracy or mistake, please leave a comment at the end, so that I can correct it.

## Who's expenses

Yours and any relative that lives with you if you paid for their medical expense.

> その年の1月1日から12月31日までの間に自己または自己と生計を一にする配偶者やその他の親族のために医療費を支払った場合において、その支払った医療費が一定額を超えるときは、その医療費の額を基に計算される金額（下記「医療費控除の対象となる金額」参照））の所得控除を受けることができます。これを医療費控除といいます。

> If you or your spouse, who shares a household with you, pay medical expenses for yourself or other relatives during the period from January 1 to December 31 of the year, and the paid medical expenses exceed a certain amount, you can receive an income deduction based on the amount of those medical expenses (see below for the amount eligible for the medical expense deduction). This is called a medical expense deduction.

You can deduct your spouse's expense even if they are not your dependent, assuming you paid for it ([source](https://www.nta.go.jp/law/shitsugi/shotoku/05/25.htm)).

## The amount

The amount one can deduct is calculated by:

(incurred medical expenses) - (any compensation, insurance payout, etc.) - 100,000 yen

> 医療費控除の金額は、次の式で計算した金額（最高で200万円）です。
> 
>（実際に支払った医療費の合計額-（1）の金額）-（2）の金額
>
>（1）保険金などで補てんされる金額
>
>（例） 生命保険契約などで支給される入院費給付金や健康保険などで支給される高額療養費・家族療養費・出産育児一時金など
>
>（注）保険金などで補てんされる金額は、その給付の目的となった医療費の金額を限度として差し引きますので、引ききれない金額が生じた場合であっても他の医療費からは差し引きません。
>
>（2）10万円
>
>（注）その年の総所得金額等が200万円未満の人は、総所得金額等の5パーセントの金額

> The amount of the medical expense deduction is calculated using the following formula (up to a maximum of 2 million yen):
> 
> (Total amount of actual medical expenses paid - Amount (1)) - Amount (2)
>
> (1) Amount compensated by insurance, etc.
>
> (Example) Such as hospitalization benefits paid under life insurance contracts, or high-cost medical care, family medical care, and lump-sum childbirth and childcare benefits paid by health insurance.
>
> (Note) The amount compensated by insurance, etc., is deducted up to the amount of medical expenses that were the purpose of the benefit. Therefore, even if there is an amount that cannot be fully deducted, it will not be deducted from other medical expenses.
> 
> (2) 100,000 yen
> 
> (Note) For people whose total annual income, etc., is less than 2 million yen, the amount is 5 percent of the total annual income, etc.

This also means that medical deduction only applies if the medical expenses are over 100,000 yen.

## Which expenses are included

This is where it gets a bit complicated.

In principle (quotes are translations of [this page](https://www.nta.go.jp/taxes/shiraberu/taxanswer/shotoku/1122.htm)):

1. Medical treatment by a doctor or dentist (it has to solve a problem, check-ups and preventative care is excluded)
    > Compensation for medical treatment or therapy by a physician or dentist (however, expenses for medical examinations and honoraria to physicians, etc. are generally not included).
2. Medicines necessary for treatment
    > Consideration for the purchase of medicines necessary for medical treatment or recuperation (the purchase of medicines such as cold remedies for a cold is considered a medical expense, but the purchase of medicines used for disease prevention or health promotion, such as vitamins, is not considered a medical expense).
3. Necessary hospital stays
    > 3 Compensation for the provision of personal services to be admitted to a hospital, clinic, long-term care health facility for the elderly, long-term care medical care hospital, designated long-term care medical facility for the elderly, designated long-term care welfare facility for the elderly, designated community-based long-term care welfare facility for the elderly, or midwifery home
4. Traditional Chinese medicine and other alternative medical treatments, if they are to treat a medical issue 
    > 4 Compensation for treatment by anma, massage, shiatsu, acupuncture, moxibustion, and judo therapy therapists (however, this does not include treatment that is not directly related to treatment such as relieving fatigue or improving physical condition).
5. Travel expenses to the hospital (with some huge asterisks) - generally only public transport costs (train, bus) are included, or taxi if public transport is not available. Expenses related to going by private car (parking, fuel) is not included
    > (1) Expenses for hospital visits to receive medical treatment by doctors, etc., transportation to and from doctors, etc., expenses for room and board during hospitalization, and expenses for the purchase or rental of medical equipment such as corsets, which are usually necessary.
    >
    > (Note 1) Taxi expenses are not included in the deductible expenses unless public transportation such as trains and buses are not available.
    >
    > (Note 2) Gasoline and parking fees for hospital visits by private car are not included in the deductible expenses.

There is a significant overlap between what health insurance covers in Japan (generally: treatment for a medical issue) and what can be included here, however there are additional expenses that are included in the tax deduction but not in the insurance.
NTA has [a long FAQ](https://www.nta.go.jp/law/shitsugi/shotoku/01.htm#b-11) on their site that aims to address most of these, so I'll list some of them that I found interesting.
