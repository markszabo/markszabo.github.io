We recently built our home in Tokyo with [Ichijo]({% post_url 2025-05-24-ichijo-referral %}). One thing that surprised me was that the house maker companies only build the house itself, and leave the outside to another company. This was the case with Ichijo too, so we had to arrange the outside construction with another company.

## Our idea

Similar to most of Tokyo, our land is pretty small so doesn't leave that much space for garden. We also wanted to have a few things:

* car parking for our minivan (without a roof)
* [a cycleport (roof for our bikes)]({% post_url 2025-06-21-cycle-port-rules %})
* a mailbox with locker for parcels (宅配ボクス)
* some tree or other greenery, if possible.

I thought this was a pretty basic idea. Later we learned that the "basic idea" is to have concrete in the front, gravel in the bank, and call it a day.

## Ichijo's introduction

Ichijo told us that they will introduce their partner company that can handle the exterior construction work. I believe the usual flow is that they will finalize the house fully before connecting you with the garden company, but we asked to meet with them earlier as we wanted to add some external lights on the house and the placement of those would depend on the outside design.

I got the feeling that this company was really good at handling the simple requests (pour concrete in the front, add gravel in the back, install the interphone and mailbox near the entrance), but they weren't well equipped to do design work with us, give us advice, or suggest alternatives. (Or maybe we just got unlucky with our contact person.)

Their first plan was already around 2 million yen, and once we asked for the additional things it quickly jumped to near 3 million yen. Also the [topic of Musashino City being strict about garden structures]({% post_url 2025-06-21-cycle-port-rules %}) came up and they essentially told us that no cycle port can fit the rules, so we either shouldn't get one, or just risk getting caught. After I looked up the rules online and sent them by email, they finally sent us a design that included a cycleport (even though it was one with 4 legs instead of 2 that we requested). Overall our experience wasn't good, so we decided to find another company.

On the other hand we have two friends who built with Ichijo, and they both went with the Ichijo-introduced company, and they were fine. So we might have gotten a bad sales, or simply we had too many unfinished ideas that just needed a different style company.

## The local company: Palgreen

My wife found a local landscaping company, [Palgreen](https://www.palgreen.info/) and reached out to them. We had our first meeting, and we were very pleasantly surprised: we got to work with someone who was really working with us. He was listening to us, but also challenging our ideas and giving alternatives. I had the idea to have interlocking tiles, because I thought that it is easier to repair and if we want to adjust the amount of greenery it makes it possible. He told us that usually you still need concrete under the tiles otherwise they will sink (especially where the car goes through), so we ended up choosing simple concrete.

He also had really good ideas about lighting, e.g. we added some floating lights at the stairs.

We also have a small corner that the other company planned to just pour gravel over, but he insisted on not wasting that and adding either a wooden deck, grass, or artificial grass. We had a good discussion on the pros and cons of real vs artificial grass, and decided to go with the latter.

He prepared graphics of how it will look like, and he really took the time to find the place for everything. Overall we met with him 3 times, each time taking a couple of hours.

## Timeline

We met with Palgreen in January 2025 first (so 1.5 months before the house design was finalized), then once more in February, and once again in June.

We signed the contract in June 2025, after the house construction started. In the end the price was 2,662,000 yen, but considering all the additional things we added (lights, artificial grass, multiple plants), I think we got a good deal. We paid half of it after signing the contract, and half after the garden was done. The bank let us include this in the mortgage too.

They could only start the work after the house was completed and handed over, which happened at the end of October. Sine the house is ready at this point, some people move in before the garden construction completes, but for our case both the moving and the daily life would have been a bit difficult with all the contraction in front of the house, so we decided to only move in after they finished the garden.
