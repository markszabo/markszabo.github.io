This week I got to help out with a video for a Japanese learning podcast episode by [Momoko sensei](http://momoko-to-nihongo.com/). I like taking photos, especially to capture life in Japan, so I was very happy for this opportunity to show them to the world. Most of the photos in the video are mine, except the ones at the purikura section. Enjoy!
