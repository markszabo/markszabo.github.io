title: No ADDress for me
---

So I had the screening/service-explanation interview for ADDress on August 1. Everything seemed fine, and they asked me to send an email with the desired start date, which I did right away. In the call they said the next step is signing the contract, so I was waiting for that, but they didn't get back to me. It's summer and people are going on holidays, so I didn't worry in the first week. After 12 days, on August 13, I sent them a follow up email, which was also left unanswered.

I looked for a phone number on their site, but couldn't find one. So on August 18 I went back to the interview scheduling form and scheduled an other interview for August 20. Later that day they sent me an email saying that unfortunately I failed their screening process and that they won't provide more details on the reason:

<p class="message">

In the email they also said that because of this they are cancelling my second interview booking. I was pretty  disappointed, when I first read the rejection. Then I started thinking about what to do next, and came up with a plan, that is in some respects even better than the original plan with ADDress. But that's a topic for a later post. Overall they had all  the rights to reject my application, however the way they did was rather unprofessional. I wonder how long would have it taken them to tell me if I would not have scheduled the second interview.
