title: "Comparing cities to live in: Musashino vs Mitaka vs Koganei"

We decided to build our own house in Tokyo. We narrowed down our area to the following stations on the Chuo line: Mitaka (Mitaka City), Musashi-sakai (Musashino City), Musashi-Koganei (Koganei City). We also considered Kichijoji, but it was way out of budget (also it gets very crowded on weekends), and Higashi-Koganei (the station between Musashi-sakai and Musashi-Koganei), but currently it lacks the shops and amenities that we got used to living at other stations. It is being actively developed, so it might get there in the next 5-10 years, but it's also between two pretty well developed stations, so chain stores might pass on opening their stores there (e.g. both neighboring stations have Ito-Yokado shopping malls, making it unlikely that there would be one in Higashi-Koganei in the future).

Choosing where to live is one of the truly life-altering decisions, especially for our children (as it affects which school they go to, their friends and their career). While big part of this can't be foreseen, I decided to take a look at the data available to compare these cities. I believe the same data is published for most cities in Japan, so even if you are looking at other places, this post might be able to help you making your own comparisons.

I tried to use data from around the same time and time period, though it wasn't always possible (some data only gets published a few years late), so I'll indicate which date the data is from.

# Population

Most metrics only really make sense on a per resident basis (e.g. city budget, number of schools), so it's important to start with that.

**Population (2023. December)** Source: [住民基本台帳による世帯と人口：毎月](https://www.toukei.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/juukim/2023/jm23010000.htm)

|           | Musashino | Mitaka | Koganei | 
| --------- | --------- | ------ | ------- |
| Population | 147,851 | 190,071 | 124,721 |
| Households | 78,685 | 96,814 | 62,937 |
| Household size (person per household) | 1.88 | 1.96 | 1.98 |

## Age groups

With Japan being an aging society, it's a good data point to know how many kids vs elderly live in a given city, as this will influence policies (which group the city should spend money on supporting), but also what types of shops open in the area.

**Population per age group (2024. January)** Source: [区市町村、年齢3区分別人口（人口総数）](https://www.toukei.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/juukiy/2024/jy24000001.htm)

|           | All of Tokyo prefecture | Musashino | Mitaka | Koganei | 
| --------- | --------- | --------- | ------ | ------- |
| 0-14 year olds | 11.07% (1,540,731) | 11.75% (17,373) | 12.31% (23,382) | 12.58% (15,682) |
| 15-64 year olds | 66.33% (9,227,915) | 65.69% (97,090) | 65.60% (124,610) | 65.86% (82,071) |
| Above 65 years | 22.59% (3,143,256) | 22.56% (33,346) | 22.09% (41,967) | 21.56% (26,861) |

Overall all 3 cities are with a 1% range, so this is essentially the same for all of them.

## Foreign population

Being from Europe, my kids will not look 100% Japanese, so knowing how much they will stand out at school is important. As the majority of foreigners in Japan are from other Asian countries, I also looked at data on which continent the foreign population is from. (There is data published down to the country-of-origin-level.)

**Foreign population (2024. January)** Source: [区市町村、国籍・地域別外国人人口](https://www.toukei.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/gaikoku/2024/ga24010000.htm)

|           | All of Tokyo prefecture | Musashino | Mitaka | Koganei |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | ------ | ------- |
| Foreign population (% of the entire population) | 4.65% (647,416) | 2.52% (3,719) | 2.28% (4,332) | 2.58% (3,212) |
| From Asia (% of the foreign population) | 87.69% (567,699) | 78.57% (2,922) | 74.68% (3,235) | 83.72% (2,689) |
| From Europe (% of the foreign population) | 5.71% (36,999) | 7.93% (295) | 10.55% (457) | 5.39% (173) |
| From Africa (% of the foreign population) | 0.69% (4,477) | 0.43% (16) | 1.39% (60) | 0.93% (30) |
| From North America (% of the foreign population) | 3.92% (25,356) | 9.63% (358) | 9.86% (427) | 7.75% (249) |
| From South America (% of the foreign population) | 1.24% (8,046) | 1.86% (69) | 1.69% (73) | 1.37% (44) |
| From Oceania (% of the foreign population) | 0.69% (4,468) | 1.59% (59) | 1.75% (76) | 0.84% (27) |

Overall Musashino and Mitaka are pretty similar in this regard. Koganei has slightly more foreigners, but a higher percentage of them come from Asian countries. This might be due to many universities being in and around Koganei, and it's being the cheapest out of the 3 cities (so international students from Asian countries might prefer living there). But this is just my guess, overall the numbers are close enough that I don't think this would result in any meaningful impact on our daily life.

**Sidenote**: since the statistics include per country breakdown, I also checked how many other Hungarians live in each city. Musashino: 1, Mitaka: 5 (I'm one from this), Koganei: 0. (In the entire Tokyo prefecture there are 254 Hungarians, but 211 of them (83%) live within the 23 special wards of Tokyo.)

# Education

Education is one area where cities can differ, so I took an extra look into the available data. Tokyo publishes the [学校基本統計（学校基本調査）- School Basic Statistics (School Basic Survey)](https://www.toukei.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/gakkou/2023/gk23qg10000.htm) each year, with the most recent being from 2023. This includes the number of schools of various levels, number of classes, number of teachers, etc. I'll share some numbers that I found interesting.

**Elementary schools (2023)**

|           | Musashino | Mitaka | Koganei | 
| --------- | --------- | ------ | ------- |
| Nr of kids | 8,173 | 9,879 | 6,751 |
| Nr of kids in public elementary school (and % of overall nr of kids) | 6,526 (80%) | 9,478 (96%) | 6,132 (91%) |
| Nr of teachers | 466 | 529 | 338 |
| Teacher per class | 1.64 | 1.61 | 1.55 |
| Teacher per class in public schools | 1.59 | 1.60 | 1.56 |

Musashino has more than twice as many kids in non-public (private, international) elementary school as the other cities. This can mean that the public schools are of lower quality, or that the parents have more money and thus more options. The teacher per class numbers are very similar, with Koganei being slightly lower, which can mean that the quality is lower, or that the number of kids is growing faster than how they can hire teachers.

Overall I don't think any of this indicates a significant difference in the expected daily life.

Schooling in Japan is [mandatory until the end of junior high school (15 years of age)](https://education.jnto.go.jp/en/school-in-japan/japanese-education-system/#:~:text=Compulsory%20education%20lasts%20for%209%20years%20through%20elementary%20and%20junior%20high%20school), so let's see what kids do after that:

**What students do after graduating junior high school** (Data from the 2023 graduations)

|           | All of Tokyo prefecture | Musashino | Mitaka | Koganei | 
| --------- | --------- | --------- | ------ | ------- |
| Go to high school | 98.65% | 99% (1,466) | 97.5% (1,435) | 96.4% (1,245) |
| Go to vocational school | 0.5% | 0.6% (9) | 1% (14) | 3.3% (43) |

(Numbers don't add up to 100% as some doesn't continue their education.)

Overall Musashino and Mitaka is almost identical, while Koganei has a slightly higher percentage going to vocational school. But the sample size is so small, that it's hard to make any conclusions. It is very likely that in either city our kids' classmates will mostly continue to high school.

**What students do after graduating high school** (Data from the 2023 graduations)

|           | All of Tokyo prefecture | Musashino | Mitaka | Koganei | 
| --------- | --------- | --------- | ------ | ------- |
| Go to university | 72.8% | 81.5% (1,032) | 81.8% (716) | 86% (1,150) |
| Go to vocational school | 15.26% | 11.6% (147) | 9% (79) | 7.9% (104) |
| Start working | 4.6% | 0% | 0.2% (2) | 1% (14) |

All 3 cities send around the same percentage to university (with Koganei being slightly higher, but that might be due to more student going to vocational school already after junior high school). At the end of the day, this again means that in either city our kids' classmates would mostly go to university.
