title: A look at life insurance in Japan

I'm starting a family, so I've been recently thinking about life insurance to ensure they won't have financial hardship if I pass early.
In this article I'll review what I found.
Please remember that I'm not a professional, and none of this is financial or tax advice.
As always, I use links to the sources, so do your own research.

> Life insurance is a contract between a life insurance company and a policy owner. A life insurance policy guarantees the insurer pays a sum of money to one or more named beneficiaries when the insured person dies in exchange for premiums paid by the policyholder during their lifetime.

Unless otherwise noted, the comparisons below use a non-smoking 30 years old man with good health.

Life expentancy at birth for [Japanese men is 81](https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14968992) and for [Hungarian men is 71](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.MA.IN?locations=HU-JP).
Since I'm already 30 with no known health issue, this is likely higher, so I'll use 80 years.

There are multiple types of life insurance:

## 1. Whole Life Insurance (終身保険)

A whole life insurance never expires: you sign a contract, and as long as you contribute the monthly contributions (which can be a fixed amount), you will receive the defined amount at your death.

Since [everyone dies](https://youtu.be/FpeZsTo5hZw?si=zONRSrOn4o-RN3WX) eventually, with this type of insurance the insurance company is guaranteed to pay.
This makes these plans more expensive than other plans, but can allow extra benefits like withdrawing from the policy while still alive or borrowing against it.
(This is based on an [American source](https://www.investopedia.com/term-life-vs-whole-life-5075430#toc-whole-life-insurance), so it might be different in Japan.)

Looking at [kakaku.com's comparison for whole life insurance](https://hoken.kakaku.com/gla/sh/hikaku/s=1/301/), the top 1 result pays 2 million yen at death and costs 2,508 yen/month.
Assuming I die at the ago of 80, in the next 50 years this would make me pay 1,504,800 yen.
This is lower than what the insurance pays due to the money loosing value over time (inflation) and as the insurance company likely invests this money.

The maximum amount [kakaku can filter for is 10 million yen](https://hoken.kakaku.com/gla/sh/hikaku/s=1/301/?DBAmount=10000000) which returns a single insurance with 14,620 yen/month contribution.

## 2. Term Life Insurance (定期保険)

[Term life insurance, as the name implies, is only good for a certain period of time, e.g. 10, 20, 30 years](https://www.investopedia.com/term-life-vs-whole-life-5075430#toc-term-life-insurance).
You pay a monthly fee during this time, and if you die during this time, then your beneficiary receives the predefined amount of money.
If the term passes and you are still alive, then the contract ends and you don't receive anything.

This type of insurance can be pretty cheap for young people, as most policy holders won't die during the term, so the insurance company can use all of their contributions to pay out the small amount of people that died.
This insurance also matches my needs better: I want to take care of my family until our kids become independent.

The [top result on kakaku](https://hoken.kakaku.com/gla/tk/hikaku/s=1/301/) is for 10 years, pays 10 million yen in case of death and costs 1,068 yen monthly.
Note that the whole life insurance for the same amount costs 14,620 yen/month, more than 10 times more.

As the term increases, the chance of policy holders dying also goes up, resulting in increased monthly costs. For example [a 25 year term insurance](https://hoken.kakaku.com/gla/tk/hikaku/s=1/301/?InsPeriodAge=55) (going until I'm 55) would cost 990 yen/month, but only pay 5 million yen (half than the 10 year term).

## 3. Income Protection Insurance (収入保障保険)

This seems to be more common in the [UK](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/insurance/types-of-insurance/income-protection-insurance/) and [Australia](https://moneysmart.gov.au/how-life-insurance-works/income-protection-insurance), but not so much in the US.
My understanding is that this is similar to a term life insurance, but instead of paying out a lump sum at death, it provides monthly payments to the beneficiary (usually until the end of the term).

There is an important concept here called 確定保証期間 (guaranteed coverage period).
Normally these insurances pay the benefit under their term ends, but if you die close to the end of the term, this guaranteed coverage period ensures that the beneficiary receives the benefit for at least this long. For example, if the insurance period is 10 years and you die in the 9th year, but the guaranteed coverage period is 2 years, benefits will be paid for 2 years. If you die in the 7th year, then the benefit is paid until the 10th year, so for 3 years.

Also some of the income protection insurances will pay you if you become disabled or otherwise unable to work (not only in case of death).

The major benefit of this insurance is that it maps the need (taking care of one's family) better, especially if one dies early.
On the other hand, the chances of dying early are pretty low, so the insurance company can keep the fees reasonable.

Again [at kakaku](https://hoken.kakaku.com/gla/dc/hikaku/s=1/301/) the top 1 result has a period until 65 years old (25 years long), has a benefit of 100,000 yen per month and costs 2,072 yen monthly. This has a guaranteed coverage period of 2 years.

Going for a higher benefit amount, kakaku tops out at 150,000 yen for 3,003 yen (also running until 65).
