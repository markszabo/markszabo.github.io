title: My plans
---

I plan on getting a dedicated place (専用ドミトリ) somewhere close to Tokyo, most probably in Chiba as that's also close to Narita (where the airport is) and I've been cycling around Chiba lately and really like it. I plan on getting rid of all my furnitures, electrical appliances and even some clothes. I'll store my winter clothes and some other stuff at the dedicated place, or rent a storage room and put them there ([there is nearby storage for ~15 000 yen a month](https://www.hello-storage.com/tokyo/taitoku/detail/5070/)).

Moving between places I considered multiple options:

* By public transportation (take the train with a suite-case)
* Buying a car - turns out to be rather complicated and expensive
* By bicycle

I'm going to start with the third option: moving around by bike. I just got a new road bike and I can cover up to 200 km a day, so that gives me a good level of flexibility and I can also take my bike on a train if needed. Having my bike with me will also help discovering the neighborhood where I'm staying.

Going by bike on the other hand further reduces the amount of things I'll be able to carry. Japanese postal services are top-notch, so I could also just keep shipping my stuff to the next address, but I plan on only using this when I need to cover very long distances. But I'll see how this all goes, I might switch to trains for the winter.
