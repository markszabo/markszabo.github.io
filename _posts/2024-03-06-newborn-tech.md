I work in tech, and while I try to maintain a healthy work-life balance, I still use many gadgets, so I thought to share which tech solutions helped us during the first month with our newborn baby.

# Mobile app for baby tracking

In the hospital we were asked to keep track of when the baby ate, peed, and pooped on a paper, and the midwifes would regularly check this. When we got home initially, we were using a similar paper-based method,but then changed to a mobile app, and it has been a game changer. We can record on either one of our smart phone or smart watch and it syncs immediately. It also calculates how much time since the last feed/sleep/diaper change, which can help us plan (she will wake up soon) and also understand why she is crying (if she just ate 30 minutes ago but hasn't changed diapers in an hour, then it might be diaper).

Based on a friend's recommendation we went with the app named [PiyoLog](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.sakabou.piyolog&hl=en&gl=US) which is developed by [a Japanese company](https://www.piyolog.com/index.html), but has English UI too.

The free version works perfectly fine. If you pay you get additional icon sets and colors, and the removal of a non-intrusive add from the bottom of the screen. I decided to pay just to support the developers (this is the first WearOS app that I find actually useful), but going with the free version is also totally fine.

# Smart watches (for parents)

Both my wife and I have a Pixel Watch, and it has been super helpful to help us keep track of our sleep. When we see that we only slept 5-6 hours a night, then we know we have to take a nap during the day, otherwise we will be really exhausted by 7pm (and that's the time our baby tends to get fussy).

Also the app we use to record things about the baby (see above) has a companion app that works on WearOS, so e.g. when we change diapers in the middle of the night, it's very easy to record it on the watch. Also we can easily check how much time has passed since the last feed, or how long she has been sleeping.

# Baby monitor

I guess this is pretty self-explanatory: when the baby sleeps during the day, it's nice that we can close the door of the bedroom and still keep an eye on her. Based on a friend's recommendation we went with [CuboAI Plus](https://refer.getcubo.com/Aq1cEjPW2GIx) (referral link), but sofar the smartness part is more of a nuance than actually useful. 

It detects if the baby's face is covered and send a notification to the phone. However our baby moves a lot and often brings her hand in front of her face for a few seconds, which results in a notification. There is also a notification every time the baby enters and leaves the view of the camera, which at this age only happens when we put the baby to bed or take her out, again not very useful at this point. There is also cry detection, which again sends a notification, even if the baby is not in her crib. So I'm often holding the baby, she cries, then I get a notification.

What works really well though is the night vision (even in pitch black room the camera feed is fully visible, although in black and white), the ability to go check the history and export 2 minutes of video from the past. Also the camera works with Google Home, so we can put the camera feed on our Nest Hub
