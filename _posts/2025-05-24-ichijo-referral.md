Ichijo, as most major house makers, offer a friend referral system.

<!--break-->

If someone who has built a house with Ichijo introduces you before you visit their showroom, and later you build a house with Ichijo, then you will receive a discount ([up to 320,000 yen](https://mii-i-smart.com/ichijo-syokai/)), while the [referring person also receives some Ichijo-points](https://www.ichijo.co.jp/shokai/) (One can use these points to buy things from Ichijo, like replacement filters for the central air system).

As we are building our house with Ichijo, I'm happy to submit a referral for you. If you are interested, please **[fill out this Google Form](https://forms.gle/J2DmCkkE5mZF1DuE9)**.

By submitting this form, you request me, Mark Szabo (<https://szabo.jp>) to submit the provided information to Ichijo (株式会社一条工務店) as a referral. After the referral is submitted, I will delete the provided information on my end. Ichijo will handle the information in accordance with their privacy policy: <https://www.ichijo.co.jp/privacy/>

Doing this also supports this blog, so thank you very much.

If you have already visited an Ichijo showroom, you may still submit the form, however in that case you won't be eligible for the discount, but I will still receive some Ichijo-points. If you found this blog useful, this is an easy way to support it.

If you have any question, reach out to me on: <ichijoreferral@szabo.jp>

## Other house maker companies

If you are interested in any other big house maker companies, I highly recommend finding someone to introduce you to them (e.g. ask around among friends, post to #random on the company Slack), as it is beneficial for both you and the referring person.
