We are building a house in Tokyo with [Ichijo 一条工務店](https://www.ichijo.co.jp/). They are known to provide outstanding cost-performance (especially in insulation), but lack on the customization options. One place where this caused us extra work was the kitchen, and I'll share our journey in this post.

<!--break-->

*I will share prices in this post, but those of course can change with time. For reference: we signed the pre-contract with Ichijo in January, 2024, and talked with the kitchen companies from the summer of 2024, signing the final contract for the selected kitchen in March 2025.*

## Our requirements

Both my wife and I like cooking, so kitchen is one of the places in the house where we spend quite a bit of time. So making sure it meets our needs and desires was important from the beginning. Our initial requirements can be summarizes as this:

* front-open, big dishwasher - Japanese homes still often don't have dishwasher or only a small one
* IH stove - since we'll have solar on the house, we decided to make our home electricity-only and won't even connect it to the gas line
* separate tap for purified water - the water filter is often included in the main tap, and one needs to press a button to switch between normal or purified water. However we have this type now, and it is common that we forget to switch.
* plenty of storage
* open feel - no overhead storage in the middle of the room (only at the walls)
* space for all of our appliances (coffee maker, rice cooker, kettle) and two microwaves (both have oven functionality, and often times when we bake something for dinner, we use the other one for heating up leftovers or baby food)

Other than the front-open dishwasher, these were pretty standard and doable with many options. However the dishwasher turned out to be the challenge.

## Dishwasher options

### Option 1: Panasonic from Ichijo

Ichijo offers multiple house lineups, which affect the available options. We went with one of their higher end option, [GRAND SMART](https://www.ichijo.co.jp/lineup/grand-smart/), which just recently introduced the option to have a front-open dishwasher from Panasonic in their Grace Kitchen:

![Ichijo's only front-open dishwasher option (price as of January 2024)](/assets/2025-04-12-custom-kitchen-with-ichijo/ichijo-panasonic-dishwasher.png#lb)

So this was one possibility, although as this was only available in a single size of the Grace Kitchen, it would have limited our choice. Moreover this is the first mode of front open dishwasher that Panasonic has ever made, and when we saw it in person, it really had that first-gen feeling: the shelves were a bit wobbly, and overall it didn't feel like it will last. (This could have been due to the machine being in a showroom where people open it much more than in normal use, but this was Panasonic's own showroom, so I would expect them to fix/replace it if it is broken.)

### Option 2: add it later

One unofficial option that Ichijo offers is that they are willing to leave the dishwasher's space empty, and you can install your own dishwasher later. [This blog](https://ameblo.jp/ironohome/entry-12664848779.html) has the costs from 2021. Based on this we would have the following costs:

* Buying the dishwasher. We found a Miele that we liked that had a list price of ¥517,000
* Fee of installing the dishwasher. The blog said ¥50,000, but likely a bit higher since then
* Fee to Ichijo to prepare the pipes and electricity connections. The blog said ¥31,260, but again, likely higher now

Still this is likely a good option for people who are happy with Ichijo's kitchen design and just want a custom dishwasher

### Option 3: fully custom kitchen

Ichijo also lets you skip their kitchen, and get the kitchen from another company. They have a relationship with many kitchen makers, so you can get a discount from the list price, and Ichijo will also give back some money for cancelling their kitchen (which is included in the price of the house), however they will charge some extra for installing the kitchen. At the end, the cancellation refund and the installation fee seemed to cancel out each other, so you are expected to pay the price of the custom kitchen. We ended up going with this option.

## Custom kitchens

There are many companies making custom kitchens, and we got estimates from a few of them. Since we did these while we were still finalizing the layout, the size of the kitchen changed between these, so direct comparison is not perfect. 

### LIXIL

The first company we talked to was LIXIL. At this point our layout would have worked best with an L shape kitchen, so we asked them for a that. Once we told that we wanted the front-open Miele dishwasher, they immediately recommended us their highest lineup (as otherwise there would be a gap at the bottom, which would look bad). 

![Lixil's kitchen design](/assets/2025-04-12-custom-kitchen-with-ichijo/lixil.png#lb)

With Miele dishwasher, Panasonic IH stove, and stainless steel counter-top this came out to be 3,643,500 yen at list price.　With Ichijo's discount this price went down to 2,883,500 yen (although it wasn't clear if we would have to pay the installation fee on top of this, or if that was already included).

### Panasonic

Next we visited Panasonic's showroom. Since we were disappointed in their front-open dishwasher (and they only use Panasonic equipment), we sort of ruled them out almost immediately. Their estimate for a kitchen very similar to LIXIL's above came in at 3,494,500 yen after the Ichijo discounts (which sealed their fate).

### Takara Standard

The next company was Takara Standard. Their appeal should be that they offer less fancy options than LIXIL for a cheaper price. We can confirm the first part, as the only color option we liked was from their highest tier.

Their estimate came in at ¥2,479,300 on list price, which went down to 2,049,600 after the Ichijo discount.

### WoodOne

We weren't really happy with either of the above options: they felt overpriced and didn't like that they all pushed us towards their most expensive lineup by pulling weird tricks like making the bottom have a gap that looks really bad with the front-open dishwasher. Also the pricing felt really arbitrary (which wasn't helped by the fact that they all sent their quotes to Ichijo only, and we had to ask our Ichijo contact to share them with us).

Until my wife found [WoodOne](https://www.woodone.co.jp/product/item/housing_cat/kitchen/): this is a company that focuses on the wooden part of the furniture they offer: they will add the equipment, but since their focus is the body of the furniture, they have better design (at least for us) and much clearer pricing: for each equipment they list its price in their catalog, and that's it. This also allowed us to compare multiple options for the IH and kitchen hood.

This comparison let us upgrade the IH stove from the standard Panasonic one (that we chose with the other makers) to a Gaggenau one, which is supposed to [truly change your life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxDOQGZqNYI). 

In the end this was the kitchen that we went with from WoodOne (the layout meanwhile changed, so instead of an L shape with got an I shape peninsula type kitchen):

![WoodOne's kitchen design](/assets/2025-04-12-custom-kitchen-with-ichijo/woodone.png#lb)

Their list price came out to 1,983,300 yen, which went down to 1,264,500 yen after the Ichijo discount. This includes the installation fee and the original kitchen's cancellation refund too.

### Price summary

So let's compare the price. For Ichijo, I added the following options (as we had similar choices with the other makers):

* Panasonic front-open dishwasher: ¥275,000
* water purifier: ¥107,000
* upgraded IH stove: ¥72,600

| Maker | List price | Discounted price |
| --- | ---- | --- |
| Ichijo with Panasonic front-open | 454,600 yen | 454,600 yen |
| Ichijo with bring-your-own Miele | 777,860 yen | 777,860 yen |
| LIXIL | 3,643,500 yen | 2,883,500 yen |
| Panasonic | *no information as they only sent the quote to Ichijo* | 3,494,500 yen |
| Takara Standard | 2,479,300 yen | 2,049,600 yen |
| WoodOne | 1,983,300 yen | 1,264,500 yen |

## Cupboard

Moreover, we also wanted to have a cupboard in the kitchen, which is a paid option from Ichijo:

![Ichijo's Grace Cupboard size and price options (as of January 2024)](/assets/2025-04-12-custom-kitchen-with-ichijo/ichijo-grace-cupboards.png#lb)

So when deciding whether to go with Ichijo or the custom maker, these had to be considered too. The comparison the table is here:

| Maker | List price | Discounted price |
| --- | ---- | --- |
| Ichijo (180cm wide Grace Cupboard) | 354,200 yen | 354,200 yen |
| LIXIL (183 cm wide) | 839,500 yen | 860,000 yen |
| Panasonic | *no information as they only sent the quote to Ichijo* | 1,197,000 yen |
| Takara Standard | 550,400 yen | 550,400 yen |
| WoodOne | 503,600 yen | 595,000 yen (up, due to installation costs) |
