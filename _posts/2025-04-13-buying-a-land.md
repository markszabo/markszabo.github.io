About a year ago we bought a plot in western Tokyo in Musashino city (see [this post]({% post_url 2024-04-19-comparing-cities-to-live %}) about why we chose this place). In this post I'll share the process and the associated costs.

## Information gathering

We started casually looking about a year before, checking both newly built houses, apartments, as well as visiting model houses and talking with building companies. This was about deciding if we wanted to buy an apartment (マンション), buy a house, or build our own house. Also if the last, then to decide the builder company. This was also the time to look into loans and consider our budget.

We set our budget like this:

* 60 million yen (6千万円) for the land
* 30 million yen (3千万円) for the house
* 10 million yen (1千万円) for fees and the inevitable unexpected costs

Which would bring the overall amount to 100 million yen, which we intended to take out entirely as loan. (In Japan banks allows you to take out more than the price of the house, as you are personally liable to pay back the loan. So if someone defaults, the bank doesn't only take the house, they can also take your savings, and other assets.)

## Looking for land

About 6-9 months before, we decided that we will build our own house. So we told the real estate agent (that we knew from a bar we used to frequent) that we are on the market for a land in our area (or [a few stations further out]({% post_url 2024-04-19-comparing-cities-to-live %})). Then he would often send us some lands by e-mail, and we went to see a few of them together. We were also casually looking at [Suumo](https://suumo.jp/) and [Homes](https://www.homes.co.jp/) to see if anything nice pops up, and also to get a feel for the price and compromises involved.

In January we decided that we will build with Ichijo and signed the pre-contract with them. This proved to be important, as now we could ask our Ichijo contact to see the lands we seriously considered and tell us if Ichijo would be able to build on it (as they manufacture pieces of the house in a factory and then [put them together with a crane](https://youtu.be/yNhGCX_bYmI?si=hICJhTyN3lsjADHK&t=47), which has to fit next to the land).

## Finding the land

In March we found a few lands that we liked, and looked at them in person together with the Ichijo person. We also spent quite a bit of time waling the neighborhoods, and looking up what's nearby on Google Maps (looking for everything from shops to restaurants, from factories to religious places, from parks to kindergartens and schools). Also checked [a bunch of publicly available information about the land]({% post_url 2024-04-22-what-to-check-before-buying-a-land-in-tokyo %}).

Finally we found a land that we really liked, good location, nice neighborhood with all that we wanted and none that we wanted to avoid. Except that it was a bit over-budget at 64.8 million yen (6,480万円). But for the location and size the price was fair, even a bit on the cheaper side due to the shape of the land: while it is a rectangle (so no [flag-pole shape](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%97%97%E7%AB%BF%E5%9C%B0)), it is narrow and long: only less than 6 m wide and more than 20 m long.

## Making an offer

We decided to increase our budget and make an offer. Our real estate agent handled the paper work, we just had to tell them the amount. He was really pushing us for making an offer at the listed price as to not loose the land. This is understandable from his point of view, since he has been showing us lands for over half a year, so he was eager to close a deal, but I expected him to help us with the negotiation, especially as it was over budget. But I know that this rarely happens in Tokyo, as real estate agents don't want to jeopardize their relationship with the other real estate agents (including the seller's).

So I asked the impartial party: our Ichijo contact. He said that while it is not unheard of to get 2-3m yen off, it is more common to ask for less discount.

So we decided to make an offer at 1 million yen before asking price. The real estate agent had to be pushed to make this offer, but he did it in the end. The seller came back with a counter offer of half million yen off. At this point it was clear that we will make a deal, and this was just about negotiating. Since the original price ended at 800,000 yen, I suggested to send a counter-counter offer asking for 800,000 yen off, which would round it down to a nice round number (64 million yen). Our real estate agent dig in his heels and said that he really doesn't recommend doing this, and we should just accept the 500,000 yen discount. I felt that we loose out on the joy. I don't care about the actual money (we are talking about like 0.3% of the overall budget), but I wanted to do it for the fun of it.

In a surprise turn of events the real estate agent asked for a moment to call his manager, then came back with a proposal: they are willing to give us 200,000 yen off from the real estate agent fee if we accept the counter offer. This was a win-win for both of us: this would give us most of the additional 300,000 yen that we wanted to ask for, and it would close the deal for the real estate agent. Moreover should we have stayed within our original budget, the real estate agent's fee (which is 3% of the price plus 60,000 plus tax) would have been about the same they will get after this discount. So we accepted it.

## Signing the initial contract

A few days after accepting the counter offer we met with the seller. We signed the initial contract and handed over the deposit (3 million yen in cash). I also learned that the 7-Eleven ATM can dispense this much cash, but only at 500,000 yen batches (as that's the limit per withdrawal). I called the bank ahead of time to increase the limit (so they were aware of the withdrawal), but I'm surprised that the 7-Eleven staff didn't even bat an eye of me emptying out half the ATM. Although if I would be running the register at minimal wage, probably I also couldn't care less.

The initial contract defined the
