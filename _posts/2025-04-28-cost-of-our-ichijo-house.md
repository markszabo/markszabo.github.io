We are building a house in Tokyo with [Ichijo 一条工務店](https://www.ichijo.co.jp/). In a previous post I covered [the costs associated with buying a land]({% post_url 2025-04-13-buying-a-land %}), and in this post I'll talk about the cost of our house built by Ichijo. There will be additional fees (e.g. garden, registration, etc.) that I will write about in a separate post once we move in. This post is only about the money we pay to Ichijo for the house itself.

## Overview

The final cost of the house was 35,605,326 yen (32,368,479 plus the 10% tax). All prices from this point will be without tax (as that's how they are shown in the estimate).

| Category (jp) | Category (en) | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ⅰ 建物本体工事御見積書 | Main building construction | 22,165,367 yen |
| Ⅱ 建築申請・その他業務諸費用 | Subsidy applications | 794,000 yen |
| Ⅲ 付帯・屋外給排水・雨水排水・浄化槽・ガス配管工事御見積書 | Outdoor water plumbing work | 1,583,700 yen |
| Ⅳ 標準仕様外工事御見積書 | Various options that we chose | 6,515,112 yen |
| Ⅴ 太陽光発電システム御見積書 | Solar panel and battery | 1,310,300 yen |
| **建物工事費合計(税抜)** | **Total building construction cost (excluding tax)** | **32,368,479 yen** |

I will break down each of these categories now.

## Main building construction - 22,165,367 yen

This depends on the size of the house, the chosen line-up ([GRAND SMART](https://www.ichijo.co.jp/lineup/grand-smart/) in our case), whether the house has to have a high fire resistance (some areas require this), and when the contract was signed.

Before we signed our contract in January 2024, these were the per tsubo prices for each line-up:

![Prices of various line-ups (as of November 2023)](/assets/2025-04-28-cost-of-our-ichijo-house/price-per-tsubo.jpg#lb)

Now, there is a small note on the top left corner: these prices apply for a 30 tsubo (99 m2, [1 tsubo is 3.3 m2](https://suumo.jp/article/oyakudachi/oyaku/sumai_nyumon/other/tsubo_heibei/)) house outside the 23 wards of Tokyo, without special fire resistance, tax included. If the house is smaller, then the per-tsubo price goes up slightly.

Our house is 95.44 m2 (29 tsubo) and we paid  232,244 yen per m2 (766,405 yen per tsubo) for this. Adding the 10% tax to this, the per-tsubo price ends up being 843,046 yen, which is slightly higher than the advertised 823,000 yen. This is likely due to the slightly smaller house, and the time difference (the prices are from November and we signed the contract in January).

During the design phase we considered switching to a cheaper line-up (i-smart), but many of the options that we wanted and were included with GRAND SMART were paid options with i-smart, so in the end we decided to stay with GRAND SMART as the savings would not have been significant.

## Subsidy applications - 794,000 yen

Ichijo builds high quality houses with great insulation, so they are eligible for many local and national subsides. Ichijo handles the paperwork to apply for these, but they charge extra for this (however the subsidies should more than offset this cost).

For us they will apply for the followings subsidies:

| Name of the subsidy | Application fee |
| --- | --- |
| 確認申請･設計住宅性能評価･低炭素申請手続及び諸費用 | 499,000 yen |
| 東京ｾﾞﾛｴﾐ住宅 申請費用 | 210,000 yen |
| 子育てグリーン住宅支援事業 | 85,000 yen |
| **Overall** | **794,000 yen** |

This is a lot, but we are expected to get somewhere between 2 to 3 million yen back, so it should work out in the end.

## Outdoor water plumbing work - 1,583,700 yen

This is to cover plumbing work outside the house, connecting the house to the water pipe already in the land. Our land was created by halving a bigger land and the other side got both the existing water and the gas connections, we will have to pay for connecting the land to the water pipes separately (we won't have gas in the house, so won't connect that).

| Item (jp) | Item (en) | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 仮設工事 | Temporary Construction | 721,000 yen |
| 屋外給水設備工事 | Outdoor water supply installation work | 219,000 yen |
| 屋外排水設備工事 | Outdoor drainage system construction | 280,900 yen |
| 特別運搬費 | Special transportation fee | 42,000 yen |
| 残土処分費 | Surplus soil disposal costs | 139,000 yen |
| 屋外雨水設備工事 | Outdoor rainwater installation work | 181,800 yen |
| **合計** | **Overall** | **1,583,700 yen** |

Connecting the land to the water pipes will be an additional 1,223,035 yen (tax included), but that is done by a different company, so it is not included in the Ichijo estimate.

## Options that we chose - 6,515,112 yen

This is the biggest additional expense to the house, and where we could have both reduced or increased the costs significantly. In the end we got 63 different options, so I will only cover the major ones, and organize those into categories.

### Custom kitchen and cupboard - 1859500 yen
