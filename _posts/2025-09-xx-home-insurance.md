We are building our house in Tokyo, and as the construction is coming to an end, we looked into home insurance.

<!--break-->

## Is it mandatory?

No, home insurance is not mandatory in Japan, although the mortgage lender might require it ([source](https://kasai.insweb.co.jp/not-subscribe/)).

## Earthquakes are special

There are two major types of coverage: earthquake and everything else. The reason for this distinction is that if a big earthquake would to hit a major city (e.g. Tokyo), then insurance providers could face bankruptcy. So the government reinsures these companies, however as a result of this, they also enforce some additional rules ([source](https://www.nihonjishin.co.jp/insurance/about.html)):

* earthquake insurance can only be bought together with fire insurance
* coverage is limited to 30-50% of the coverage of the fire insurance. This means that while fire insurance might pay the entire value of the house, earthquake insurance will only pay half or less
* fire, tsunami, vulcanic erruptions, etc. that happen as a result of an earthquake will be covered by the earthquake insurance (with the lower limits)
* pre-defined damage classifications (e.g. partial loss of 3-20% will pay 5% of the insured value)
* if the overall (country-wide) damage is truly huge (exceeds a government defined amount calculated by the damage the [1923 Great Kanto Earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1923_Great_Kant%C5%8D_earthquake) would cause today), then all payouts will be scaled down by the same percentage

This does mean that if your house gets destroyed after an earthquake, the insurance won't cover the cost of rebuilding. Some insurance companies offer additional insurance to bring the coverage up to 100%, but those can be expensive, and as they are not part of the government reinsured scheme, they might not get paid if the insurance company goes down.

## Fireproof houses

Since fire insurance is the mandatory, basic block of the home insurance, a lot depends on how fireproof the house is. This depends on the building structure (建物の構造). For the calculation there is a [common flowchart used by many websites](https://hoken.kakaku.com/kasai/select/kouzou/#:~:text=%E8%A9%B2%E5%BD%93%E3%81%97%E3%81%AA%E3%81%84%E5%BB%BA%E7%89%A9-,%E6%A7%8B%E9%80%A0%E7%B4%9A%E5%88%A5%E3%81%AE%E5%88%A4%E5%AE%9A%E3%83%9D%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%83%88,-%E5%BB%BA%E7%89%A9%E3%81%AE%E6%A7%8B%E9%80%A0):

![Fire resitancy classification flowchart (source: https://hoken.kakaku.com)](/assets/2025-09-xx-home-insurance/kasai_kouzou_chart.png#lb)

Which comes down to the following for single-family houses:

* Are the pillars "Concrete structure" or "Steel frame structure"?
  * Yes → T-Structure (Fire-resistant Structure)
  * No → Is it fire-resistant (耐火建築物), semi-fire-resistant (準耐火建築物), or quasi-fire-resistant by ministerial ordinance (省令準耐火)?
    * Yes → T-Structure (Fire-resistant Structure)
    * No → H-Structure (Other Structures)

[All Ichijo houses are all quasi-fire-resistant by ministerial ordinance (省令準耐火)](https://www.ichijo.co.jp/technology/element/fireproof/#:~:text=%E4%B8%80%E6%9D%A1%E3%81%AE%E5%AE%B6%E3%81%AF%E3%80%81%E7%81%AB%E3%81%AB%E5%BC%B7%E3%81%84%E3%80%8C%E7%9C%81%E4%BB%A4%E6%BA%96%E8%80%90%E7%81%AB%E6%A7%8B%E9%80%A0%E3%80%8D%E3%81%AB%E9%81%A9%E5%90%88%E3%80%82%E4%B8%87%E3%81%8C%E4%B8%80%E3%81%AE%E7%81%AB%E7%81%BD%E3%81%AE%E3%81%A8%E3%81%8D%E3%82%82%E3%80%81%E8%A2%AB%E5%AE%B3%E3%82%92%E6%9C%80%E5%B0%8F%E9%99%90%E3%81%AB%E6%8A%91%E3%81%88%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82%E3%81%BE%E3%81%9F%E3%80%81%E3%80%8C%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A4%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%83%83%E3%83%97%E6%A7%8B%E9%80%A0%E3%80%8D%E3%81%AB%E3%82%88%E3%82%8A%E3%80%81%E7%81%AB%E3%81%AE%E9%80%9A%E3%82%8A%E9%81%93%E3%81%A8%E3%81%AA%E3%82%8B%E5%A3%81%E3%81%AA%E3%81%A9%E3%81%AE%E5%86%85%E5%81%B4%E3%81%AB%E3%81%8A%E3%81%84%E3%81%A6%E3%80%81%E6%9E%A0%E7%B5%84%E6%9D%90%E3%81%8C%E7%A9%BA%E6%B0%97%E3%81%AE%E6%B5%81%E3%82%8C%E3%82%92%E9%81%AE%E6%96%AD%E3%81%97%E3%80%81%E7%81%AB%E3%81%AE%E7%87%83%E3%81%88%E5%BA%83%E3%81%8C%E3%82%8A%E3%82%92%E3%81%8F%E3%81%84%E6%AD%A2%E3%82%81%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82) so we fall into the T-Structure category resulting in a lower insurance premiums.

## Ichijo introduced insurance (Tokyo Marine)

Ichijo sent us a letter back in May (around the time they started building the foundation) telling us that we don't need to worry about home insurance, they will introduce a great deal for us at a later time. It felt a bit too much to send a paper letter just for this, but I guess they had people ask or get their own insurance before the introduction.

Then in August (so about 2 months before the house is ready) we got the details in the mail: red big letters  saying that we will save 80% due to this great deal. The insurance company is [東京海上日動, Tokyo Marine Nichido](https://www.tokiomarine-nichido.co.jp/) one of the 3 big non-life insurance companies of Japan ([三メガ損保](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20250520/k10014811401000.html)).

Details of the quote:

* Insured amounts for fireinsurance (everything other than earthquake)
  * House: 35.6 million yen
  * Personal belongings: 500,000 yen
* Insured amounts for earthquake (half the above)
  * House: 17.8 million yen
  * Personal belongings: 250,000 yen
* Length: 5 year
* Deductible (amount to pay out of pocket): 0 yen, except for damage caused by other people (neighbor, break-in) or ourselves (which have a deductible of 50,000 yen)

They included 3 potential plans. All 3 includes fire, wind, water (flooding), and earthquake damages. All amounts are for the full 5 years to be paid at once at start.

* Basic plan (基本しっかりプラン): only the above coverage for **230,200 yen**
* Solid and secure plan (がっちり安心補償プラン): also includes damages by other people - break-ins, neighbor damaging your place (more relevant for apartments) for **238,880 yen**
* Complete peace of mind plan (まるごと安心補償プラン): also includes damages by other people (same as #2), and damages by ourselves (e.g. dropping an expensive vase, breaking the wall when moving heavy things) for **249,430 yen**

The plans are not that different in price, but also the coverage doesn't really increase (remember, the additional coverages of #2 and #3 all come with a 50,000 yen deductible).

### Long phone calls

A few weeks after receiving the letter with the above information, I got a phone call from Tokyo Marine wanting to discuss the insurance. It took about 40 minutes mainly because both me, my wife, but also the insurance person was unprepared (e.g. I was surprised by earthquake insurance covering only half and wanted to know the reason, which the person didn't know).

One optional extra that I wanted to add was the personal liability insurance (個人賠償責任補償特約). This covers cases where someone from my family injures another person or causes damage to their property (e.g. kids dropping something in a store, breaking a friend's TV, scratching a car). I was told that this costs 10,050 yen (coverage limit of 100 million yen) or 11,300 yen (without limit) for the 5 years. Pretty reasonable. So I asked them if I can just add this when I scan the QR code on the paper, and I was told that no, they will have to send me a new paper letter with a new QR code. On the QR code I can only pay for the insurance detailed on paper.

We asked if insurance claims are also handled over the phone, and they told us that no, they have a website for that. They also said that generally they pay the insurance claims within 30 days, but if there is a major earthquake in Tokyo, then it would likely take longer.

Our address wasn't finalized yet, so they asked if they could call us a week later to get that updated (again, sending another letter with the new contract). They said they can't do this via e-mail, only on the phone, so we agreed. Second phone call also took longer than 20 minutes.

By this point my wife was pretty unhappy with the whole process: having a mostly pointless long phone call, having to reissue the paper for all minor change, etc. I was also concerned that this is the process where they want to take our money, and if this process is so bad, then imagine the insurance claims process where we are trying to take their money. I have very little hope that it would be more user friendly.

## Kakaku to the rescue

Similar to [my car insurance experience]({% post_url  2025-08-03-car-insurance %}) I took a look at [価格.com](https://kakaku.com/), the a well-known price comparison website. On their [home insurance section](https://hoken.kakaku.com/kasai/) I searched for the same content as we got from Tokyo Marine:

![Searching on kakaku.com](/assets/2025-09-xx-home-insurance/kakaku-search.png#lb)

And the results didn't look very good:

![Results on kakaku.com](/assets/2025-09-xx-home-insurance/kakaku-results.png#lb)

Was the Ichijo-special Tokyo Marine offer actually a good deal? It wasn't that far off, so I decided to take a look on the insurance website to see if I can remove some unnecessary coverage and get it down to be competitive with Tokyo Marine.

## Sony insurance

I had great experience with Sony travel insurance in the past (and also this was the cheapest company that I recognized the name of), so I decided to check them. Kakaku also listed that they pay claims within 2 business days in general (4 business days in some cases), which is much better than the 30 day promise of Tokyo Marine.

I go through the Sony insurance wizard and get an estimate of 201,420 yen (for the full, everything included plan). How did the Kakaku 334,553 yen go down this much? I believe it's because Kakaku didn't ask for the earthquake resistance of the building, and since Ichijo houses have the highest (level 3) earthquake resistance, that saves 50% of the earthquake insurance part of the quote.

### Make earthquake insurance cover 100%

Sony has the additional option to increase the earthquake coverage to 100% (technically it is a separate insurance that pays out the same amount as the earthquake insurance if at least half the house is destroyed). The cost of this is 182,290 yen for 5 years, almost doubling the price of the insurance.

Since our house is pretty earthquake and fire resistant, we decided not to take this.

## Fine-tuning

We don't really have expensive belongings, so decided to limit the coverage to the house-only (the original quote had a coverage of 5 million yen for things inside the house). The site also showed us the breakdown cost of each option:

* Earthquake (incl volcanic eruptions and tsunami): 114,900 yen
* Fire, lightning, rupture/explosion: 9,445 yen (mandatory)
* Wind, hail, snow: 6,837 yen
* Water (typhoon, storm, floods, landslides): 32,014 yen
* Water damage from burst pipes, collision with external objects (including vehicles, and vandalism): 4,966 yen
* Break-in: 720 yen
* Personal liability compensation (for the entire family): 7,161 yen

This gave us the option to fine-tune the coverage and get what we think is necessary.
