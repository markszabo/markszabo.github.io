We are building our house in Tokyo, and as the construction is coming to an end, we looked into home insurance.

## Is it mandatory?

No, home insurance is not mandatory in Japan, although the mortgage lender might require it ([source](https://kasai.insweb.co.jp/not-subscribe/)).

## Earthquakes are special

There are two major types of coverage: earthquake and everything else. The reason for this distinction is that if a big earthquake would to hit a major city (e.g. Tokyo), then insurance providers could face bankruptcy. So the government reinsures these companies, however as a result of this, they also enforce some additional rules ([source](https://www.nihonjishin.co.jp/insurance/about.html)):

* earthquake insurance can only be bought together with fire insurance
* coverage is limited to 30-50% of the coverage of the fire insurance. This means that while fire insurance might pay the entire value of the house, earthquake insurance will only pay half or less
* fire, tsunami, vulcanic erruptions, etc. that happen as a result of an earthquake will be covered by the earthquake insurance (with the lower limits)
* pre-defined damage classifications (e.g. partial loss of 3-20% will pay 5% of the insured value)
* if the overall (country-wide) damage is truly huge (exceeds a government defined amount calculated by the damage the [1923 Great Kanto Earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1923_Great_Kant%C5%8D_earthquake) would cause today), then all payouts will be scaled down by the same percentage

This does mean that if your house gets destroyed after an earthquake, the insurance won't cover the cost of rebuilding. Some insurance companies offer additional insurance to bring the coverage up to 100%, but those can be expensive, and as they are not part of the government reinsured scheme, they might not get paid if the insurance company goes down.

## Fireproof houses

Since fire insurance is the mandatory, basic block of the home insurance, a lot depends on the fireproof-ness of the house. This depends on the building structure (建物の構造). For the calculation there is a [common flowchart used by many websites](https://hoken.kakaku.com/kasai/select/kouzou/#:~:text=%E8%A9%B2%E5%BD%93%E3%81%97%E3%81%AA%E3%81%84%E5%BB%BA%E7%89%A9-,%E6%A7%8B%E9%80%A0%E7%B4%9A%E5%88%A5%E3%81%AE%E5%88%A4%E5%AE%9A%E3%83%9D%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%83%88,-%E5%BB%BA%E7%89%A9%E3%81%AE%E6%A7%8B%E9%80%A0) which comes down to the following for single-family houses:

* **Are the pillars "Concrete structure" or "Steel frame structure"?
  * Yes → T-Structure (Fire-resistant Structure)
  * **No → Is it a "Fire-resistant (耐火建築物) / Semi-fire-resistant (準耐火建築物) building" or a "Quasi-fire-resistant (省令準耐火) building (by ministerial ordinance)"?
    * Yes → T-Structure (Fire-resistant Structure)
    * No → H-Structure (Other Structures)
