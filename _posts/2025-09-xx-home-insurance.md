We are building our house in Tokyo, and as the construction is coming to an end, we looked into home insurance.

<!--break-->

## Is it mandatory?

No, home insurance is not mandatory in Japan, although the mortgage lender might require it ([source](https://kasai.insweb.co.jp/not-subscribe/)).

## Earthquakes are special

There are two major types of coverage: earthquake and everything else. The reason for this distinction is that if a big earthquake would to hit a major city (e.g. Tokyo), then insurance providers could face bankruptcy. So the government reinsures these companies, however as a result of this, they also enforce some additional rules ([source](https://www.nihonjishin.co.jp/insurance/about.html)):

* earthquake insurance can only be bought together with fire insurance
* coverage is limited to 30-50% of the coverage of the fire insurance. This means that while fire insurance might pay the entire value of the house, earthquake insurance will only pay half or less
* fire, tsunami, vulcanic erruptions, etc. that happen as a result of an earthquake will be covered by the earthquake insurance (with the lower limits)
* pre-defined damage classifications (e.g. partial loss of 3-20% will pay 5% of the insured value)
* if the overall (country-wide) damage is truly huge (exceeds a government defined amount calculated by the damage the [1923 Great Kanto Earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1923_Great_Kant%C5%8D_earthquake) would cause today), then all payouts will be scaled down by the same percentage

This does mean that if your house gets destroyed after an earthquake, the insurance won't cover the cost of rebuilding. Some insurance companies offer additional insurance to bring the coverage up to 100%, but those can be expensive, and as they are not part of the government reinsured scheme, they might not get paid if the insurance company goes down.

## Fireproof houses

Since fire insurance is the mandatory, basic block of the home insurance, a lot depends on how fireproof the house is. This depends on the building structure (建物の構造). For the calculation there is a [common flowchart used by many websites](https://hoken.kakaku.com/kasai/select/kouzou/#:~:text=%E8%A9%B2%E5%BD%93%E3%81%97%E3%81%AA%E3%81%84%E5%BB%BA%E7%89%A9-,%E6%A7%8B%E9%80%A0%E7%B4%9A%E5%88%A5%E3%81%AE%E5%88%A4%E5%AE%9A%E3%83%9D%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%83%88,-%E5%BB%BA%E7%89%A9%E3%81%AE%E6%A7%8B%E9%80%A0):

Which comes down to the following for single-family houses:

* Are the pillars "Concrete structure" or "Steel frame structure"?
  * Yes → T-Structure (Fire-resistant Structure)
  * No → Is it fire-resistant (耐火建築物), semi-fire-resistant (準耐火建築物), or quasi-fire-resistant by ministerial ordinance (省令準耐火)?
    * Yes → T-Structure (Fire-resistant Structure)
    * No → H-Structure (Other Structures)

[All Ichijo houses are all quasi-fire-resistant by ministerial ordinance (省令準耐火)](https://www.ichijo.co.jp/technology/element/fireproof/#:~:text=%E4%B8%80%E6%9D%A1%E3%81%AE%E5%AE%B6%E3%81%AF%E3%80%81%E7%81%AB%E3%81%AB%E5%BC%B7%E3%81%84%E3%80%8C%E7%9C%81%E4%BB%A4%E6%BA%96%E8%80%90%E7%81%AB%E6%A7%8B%E9%80%A0%E3%80%8D%E3%81%AB%E9%81%A9%E5%90%88%E3%80%82%E4%B8%87%E3%81%8C%E4%B8%80%E3%81%AE%E7%81%AB%E7%81%BD%E3%81%AE%E3%81%A8%E3%81%8D%E3%82%82%E3%80%81%E8%A2%AB%E5%AE%B3%E3%82%92%E6%9C%80%E5%B0%8F%E9%99%90%E3%81%AB%E6%8A%91%E3%81%88%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82%E3%81%BE%E3%81%9F%E3%80%81%E3%80%8C%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A4%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%83%83%E3%83%97%E6%A7%8B%E9%80%A0%E3%80%8D%E3%81%AB%E3%82%88%E3%82%8A%E3%80%81%E7%81%AB%E3%81%AE%E9%80%9A%E3%82%8A%E9%81%93%E3%81%A8%E3%81%AA%E3%82%8B%E5%A3%81%E3%81%AA%E3%81%A9%E3%81%AE%E5%86%85%E5%81%B4%E3%81%AB%E3%81%8A%E3%81%84%E3%81%A6%E3%80%81%E6%9E%A0%E7%B5%84%E6%9D%90%E3%81%8C%E7%A9%BA%E6%B0%97%E3%81%AE%E6%B5%81%E3%82%8C%E3%82%92%E9%81%AE%E6%96%AD%E3%81%97%E3%80%81%E7%81%AB%E3%81%AE%E7%87%83%E3%81%88%E5%BA%83%E3%81%8C%E3%82%8A%E3%82%92%E3%81%8F%E3%81%84%E6%AD%A2%E3%82%81%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82) so we fall into the T-Structure category resulting in a lower insurance premiums.

## Ichijo introduced insurance (Tokyo Marine)

Ichijo sent us a letter back in May (around the time they started building the foundation) telling us that we don't need to worry about home insurance, they will introduce a great deal for us at a later time. It felt a bit too much to send a paper letter just for this, but I guess they had people ask or get their own insurance before the introduction.

Then in August (so about 2 months before the house is ready) we got the details in the mail: red big letters  saying that we will save 80% due to this great deal. The insurance company is [東京海上日動, Tokyo Marine Nichido](https://www.tokiomarine-nichido.co.jp/) one of the 3 big non-life insurance companies of Japan ([三メガ損保](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20250520/k10014811401000.html)).

Details of the quote:

* Insured amounts for fireinsurance (everything other than earthquake)
  * House: 35.6 million yen
  * Personal belongings: 500,000 yen
* Insured amounts for earthquake (half the above)
  * House: 17.8 million yen
  * Personal belongings: 250,000 yen
* Length: 5 year
* Deductible (amount to pay out of pocket): 0 yen, except for damage caused by other people (neighbor, break-in) or ourselves (which have a deductible of 50,000 yen)

They included 3 potential plans. All 3 includes fire, wind, water (flooding), and earthquake damages. All amounts are for the full 5 years to be paid at once at start.

* Basic plan (基本しっかりプラン): only the above coverage for **230,200 yen**
* Solid and secure plan (がっちり安心補償プラン): also includes damages by other people - break-ins, neighbor damaging your place (more relevant for apartments) for **238,880 yen**
* Complete peace of mind plan (まるごと安心補償プラン): also includes damages by other people (same as #2), and damages by ourselves (e.g. dropping an expensive vase, breaking the wall when moving heavy things) for **249,430 yen**

The plans are not that different in price, but also the coverage doesn't really increase (remember, the additional coverages of #2 and #3 all come with a 50,000 yen deductible)
