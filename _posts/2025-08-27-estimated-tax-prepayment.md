On July 31st my bank account had a direct debit charge of 52,900 yen with the note `シンコクシヨトクゼイ`. This is how I learned about the estimated tax prepayment system.

## Background

As a salaried employee my company mostly handles my taxes. I have some investments in an Interactive Brokers account where tax is not withheld, and I have ETFs and stocks there that pay some dividend, so I still need to file tax in February to declare those and pay the tax. Since dividends from US securities get taxed 10% in the US, I can claim foreign tax credit and pay only another 10% tax in Japan. This usually comes out to about 20-30,000 yen tax to pay, and I have been paying that in February each year.

However last year I did a rebalance in the investment account (sold some ETFs and bought another one), which meant I realized 1.2 million yen gains, which meant [I was on the hook for 240,000 yen capital gains tax]({% post_url 2025-03-11-capital-gains-tax %}). Moreover dividends were also higher than usual, resulting in an additional 38,000 yen tax from that. I paid these in February and didn't think of it more. But the NTA thought differently.

## Pay your taxes early

If based on last year's income the tax office estimates that you will have 150,000 yen or more tax to pay, then they will charge 1/3 of it in July (first installment, 第１期分) and 1/3 of it in November (second installment, 第２期分).

If your income is expected to be less than last year, then you can ask for an exemption, but since I wasn't charged that much, I decided to just go ahead with it.

At tax filing time, I will need to include this and it will be used to offset any outstanding tax obligation, and the rest will be refunded. So it is not an extra tax, simply a prepayment.

How they arrived to the 52,900 yen amount that I was charged, I'm not sure. Based on the extra tax I had to pay last year, I would have expected it to be more, but I won't complain.

## Online notification

I actually got very lucky that I had my bank account's direct debit configured with the tax office. During tax filing there was a section to ask for electronic delivery of the estimated tax amount notice that I likely selected, which meant I didn't get any paper notification:

> なお、令和６年分の所得税及び復興特別所得税の確定申告において、予定納税額の通知書の「電子交付」を希望した方については、予定納税額の通知書を書面の送付に代えてe-Taxにより通知しています。

However electronic notification is not an email, but rather a notification in e-Tax, which I totally missed. So should I not have had the direct debit configured, I would have had a late tax payment. Yikes.

[This reddit answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/comments/1n0dqz6/comment/napvo6w/) has the steps to check the e-Tax notifications:

* login to <https://myna.go.jp> and to go to the message box `お知らせ` at the top right of the page
* There you should have a message titled `【税務署からのお知らせ】予定納税等通知書に関するお知らせ` from June
* Open it and click the link `e-Taxメッセージボックスへ`
* That will have a button to pay directly from your bank account or via credit card

I also had the message there informing me of the amount that was later taken. A message that I totally missed.
