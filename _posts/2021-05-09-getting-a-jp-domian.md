title: Getting a .jp domain
---

I have a super common family name in Hungary: Szabo. It means tailor, and appr. 2% of Hungarians have this family name ([203,126](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szab%C3%B3) out of [9,730,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Hungary)). Thus szabo.hu, szabo.eu, szabo.com, szabo.net, szabo.info, szabo.me, szabo.xyz etc. are mostly taken. However I recently checked and szabo.jp was available! Following a [Tokyo Cheapo guide](https://tokyocheapo.com/business/registering-jp-domains-for-cheap/) I found [Star Domain](https://www.star-domain.jp?ref=NA99yyrv) and bought the domain there for 2560 yen/year. (Star Domain has a referral program, so if you use this link, I might earn a little money.)

I already had hosting elsewhere, so I only needed the domain and Star Domain has a [pretty straightforward DNS configurator](https://www.star-domain.jp/man/man_dns_setting.php). I read that only people in Japan can register `.jp` domains, so I expected some verification, but only my phone number was checked and after I paid for the domain, I could use it immediately.

Most part of the site is text based, so Google Translate makes it possible to use it without knowing too much Japanese.
