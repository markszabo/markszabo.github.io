After being rejected from ADDress, I abandonded this blog and focused on [my blog in Hungarian](https://japan.szabo-simon.hu/). However a lot has changed recently, and I feel the need of a place to publish in English. Thus I decided to reuse this blog, but shift the focus from the original digital nomad life to more general life in Japan with occasional tech related articles. For this reason I also got a new domain name: szabo.jp. Szabo (read as サボー) being my family name.

Enjoy!
