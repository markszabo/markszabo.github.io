title: How ADDress works
---

As of now this is my understanding about how [ADDress](http://address.love/) works. I could be missing something, and rules can change later, so take it with a grain of salt.

ADDress is a service which allows to live in any of their homes all around Japan for a fixed monthly fee. Currently they have 52 locations and the basic fee is 40 000 yen (+10% tax), which includes all the utilities, shower toiletries and bedsheets. There is no extra initial costs (e.g. key-money or deposit). The contract is for a year, but can be cancelled earlier with 2 months notice.

## Rules of booking

There are some rules about booking your private room:

* Rooms can be booked 3 months in advance
* At any point in time one can have maximum 14 nights booked (保有予約日数14日まで)
* At any point in time one can have maximum 7 nights booked at a single place (同一拠点の連続予約7日まで 。後ろが空いていれば、消化した分を付け加えて伸ばすことは可能)
* In any month maximum 14 nights can be stayed at a single place (同一拠点の、一か月あたり滞在上限14日まで)

It is possible to book a week at a place, and after the first night book the 8th night at the same place, if it is still available, but one can only do this up to 2 weeks (see last rule). Although there might be a way to bypass this: if the last rule is enforced by calendar month, one might stay the last 2 weeks of a month and then the first 2 of the next month at a place. We'll see if this works.

## Dedicated place (専用ドミトリ)

This is an extra option one can choose to have a dedicated room or bed (in a shared room), that one can use as much as they like. This can also be used to [officially register one's address here, receive letters](https://address.zendesk.com/hc/ja/articles/360041491013-%E4%BD%8F%E6%B0%91%E7%A5%A8%E3%82%92%E7%BD%AE%E3%81%8F%E3%81%93%E3%81%A8%E3%81%AF%E3%81%A7%E3%81%8D%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%81%8B-) and [to store stuff](https://address.zendesk.com/hc/ja/articles/360040826894-%E5%B0%82%E7%94%A8%E3%83%89%E3%83%9F%E3%83%88%E3%83%AA%E3%81%AB-%E8%8D%B7%E7%89%A9%E3%82%92%E7%BD%AE%E3%81%8D%E3%81%A3%E3%81%B1%E3%81%AA%E3%81%97%E3%81%AB%E3%81%A7%E3%81%8D%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%81%8B-). [Beds only have the frame](https://address.zendesk.com/hc/ja/articles/360041006014-%E5%B0%82%E7%94%A8%E3%83%89%E3%83%9F%E3%83%88%E3%83%AA%E3%81%AB%E5%AF%9D%E5%85%B7%E3%81%AF%E3%81%82%E3%82%8A%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%81%8B-), so one need to bring their mattress and bedding.

There is no information on the price of this option on the main site, and it was only revealed later in the signup process. The price greatly depends on the location and whether it's for a private room or only a bunk-bed in a dormitory room (rooms separated by gender). Beds are 15 000 - 30 000 yen and rooms are 31 000 - 215 000 yen.

## Staying with family, partner, friends

This doesn't apply to me, but there is an option for [family members up to second degree to stay with you in the same room](https://address.zendesk.com/hc/ja/articles/360039370014-%E5%AE%B6%E6%97%8F%E3%82%84%E3%83%91%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%83%8A%E3%83%BC%E3%81%A8%E4%B8%80%E7%B7%92%E3%81%AB%E5%88%A9%E7%94%A8%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B%E3%81%93%E3%81%A8%E3%81%AF%E5%8F%AF%E8%83%BD%E3%81%A7%E3%81%99%E3%81%8B-). They need to register in advance and go through identity verification and screening, but otherwise it seems that it doesn't cost extra. One can also register a partner to stay with them, however the [partner can only be changed once every 3 months](https://address.zendesk.com/hc/ja/articles/360039737173--%E3%82%AB%E3%83%83%E3%83%97%E3%83%AB-%E5%8F%8B%E9%81%94%E3%81%A8%E3%81%AE%E5%88%A9%E7%94%A8%E3%81%AF%E5%8F%AF%E8%83%BD%E3%81%A7%E3%81%99%E3%81%8B-).


## Cleaning

ADDress makes it very clear that this is not a hotel, and you are expected to clean your room before leaving. Common areas are cleaned regularly by the house manager, but guests are expected to not leave a mess.
