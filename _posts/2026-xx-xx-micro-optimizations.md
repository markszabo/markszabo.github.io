title: "The everyday micro-optimizations of Japan"

Being passionate about perfection at one's profession is often associated with Japan. As a result of this, Japan is full of everyday micro-optimizations: where other countries accept the small inconvenience or imperfection, Japan often seem to go the extra mile to address minor nuances. Sometimes the solution is high-tech and expensive, but sometimes surprisingly simple.

This aspect of life in Japan is one of the main reasons I decided to stay. In this post I'll share my list of favorite examples of this. Having grown up in Hungary, and lived for a short while in Germany and Italy, my comparison is those countries, so some of these might be found outside of Japan too. Also things generally improve, and having lived in Japan for nearly 7 years, it is possible that some of these have been adopted in my home country too.

The part that I love about these minor improvements is how prevalent they are in Japan: very often across all brands and ages. It is as-if someone found out about them 50 years ago, and since then everyone agrees that we should have them.

## Sign to show which side the fuel tank is in a car

All cars I have rented in Japan had a small arrow/triangle on the instrument cluster showing which side the fuel tank is. This costs almost nothing to the manufacturer, but it is immensely helpful. I was surprised to not have these in Hungary when I visited.

[95% of the cars in Japan are domestic](https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/japan-automotive), and I have yet to rent a non-Japanese car, so not sure if every car has it, but the cars I have rented all had this.

## Duvet cover ties

Continuing the low-tech solutions: the Japanese-made duvet-covers all have ties in the corners (and often in the middle of the sides too). The duvets have the hook where these attach. Together they solve the worldwide problem of the duvet slipping/folding inside the cover. The part that I love about this is that it only works if both the duvet and the cover has them, but all that I have seen (except IKEA) had them.

## Buried pipe marker line

Maybe it's common elsewhere as well, but I found this very clever: to avoid accidentally damaging an underground water pipe, they burry a plastic line over the pipe. This way if someone starts digging, they should hit this line first and hopefully stop before hitting the pipe itself.

I only saw this once, so I'm not sure how common this is even in Japan, but I felt it fits in this list.

## Turning train seats

Trains tend to go forward and backward. This usually results in half the seats facing backwards, which most people dislike. To address this, most trains in Japan have seats that can turn:

As a kid I hated sitting backwards, so this makes me very happy: engineers took an everyday problem, came up with a solution, then rolled it out country-wide. The final piece of this puzzle is the process: at the last stop of the line, staff will go through the train and turn each seat (newer trains have this automated).

## Vending machines

Many countries have vending machines, but a few has as many as Japan. I especially love that during colder months, part of the vending machines switch to hot drinks (these are bottled or canned drinks that are kept hot).

And you find these vending machines everywhere, even on the country side, which is great [when cycling]({% post_url 2025-11-14-cycling-all-around-japan %}).

## Convenience stores

Convenience stores are not unique to Japan, but they have an immense amount of innovation here. Many have ATMs, copy machines (that also let you print government certificates), let you send and receive parcels. They have freshly made food (fried chicken, steamed meat buns), and fresh coffee.
